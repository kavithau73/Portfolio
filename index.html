            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>"Hi, I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering. 
                Although my academic background is in engineering, I have always had a keen interest in programming
                and enjoy the challenge of problem-solving through coding. I am currently learning various programming 
                languages and expanding my skills in the field of web development. As a DSA learner,
                In addition, I am also learning the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
                I am passionate about coding and strive to continually learn and improve my skills as a developer."</p>
