            <p>
            "Hi, I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and  
            Communication Engineering. Although my academic background is in engineering,
            I have always had a keen interest in programming and enjoy the challenge of 
            problem-solving through coding. I am currently learning various programming 
            languages and expanding my skills in the field of web development. As a DSA learner,
            In addition, I am also learning the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js,
            React, and Node.js. I am passionate about coding and strive to continually learn 
            and improve my skills as a developer."

            <h2>Projects</h2>

                    <p>
                        The MERN stack shopping app project is a web-based application that allows
                          users to shop for various products online. The application is built using
                          the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. 
                          The front-end of the application is built using React, which provides an 
                          interactive and responsive user interface for the shopping experience. 
                          The back-end of the application is built using Node.js and Express.js, 
                          which provide the server-side functionality for handling user requests 
                          and database operations. The data for the products is stored in MongoDB, 
                          which provides a scalable and flexible NoSQL database solution. The
                           application allows users to create an account, browse through various 
                           products, add items to their cart, and make payments for their orders. 
                           It also includes features such as search and filtering options.
                           Overall, the MERN stack shopping app project provides a comprehensive 
                           e-commerce solution that showcases the capabilities of the MERN stack 
                           for web development.
